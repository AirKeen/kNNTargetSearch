# k-Nearest Neighbours Target Search

This repo contains the code for simulating and performing analysis of a swarm of decentralised agents tracking a target in random motion around a search space. The code used to run the simulation and perform data analysis can be found in `code` and the data used for generating the plots and videos can be found in `data`.

## Usage
### Dependencies
The code for the simulation is written using Julia 1.1 (Click [here](https://julialang.org/) to install), while the codes for data analysis are written using Python 3.6. The following Python packages need to be installed to run the codes properly:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- PyLaTeX
